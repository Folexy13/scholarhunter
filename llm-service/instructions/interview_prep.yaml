    output: |
      {
        "question": "The Rhodes Scholarship values 'fighting the world's fight.' Can you describe a time when you took a stand on an issue that was unpopular or difficult, and what you learned from that experience?",
        "category": "Leadership",
        "difficulty": "Hard",
        "tips": [
          "Choose a genuine example where you showed moral courage",
          "Explain the context and why the issue mattered",
          "Describe the risks or challenges you faced",
          "Focus on what you learned, not just what you achieved",
          "Connect to your values and future goals",

      QUESTION: "Why do you deserve this scholarship?"
      STUDENT_ANSWER: "I deserve this scholarship because I have a 4.0 GPA and I've been involved in many activities. I work really hard and I think I would be a good representative for your organization. I really need the money to pay for school."
      SCHOLARSHIP: Merit-based leadership scholarship
    
    output: |
      {
        "overall_score": 4,
        "strengths": [
          "Mentioned academic achievement",
          "Expressed enthusiasm for the scholarship",
          "Acknowledged the organization"
        ],
        "improvements": [
          "Answer is too generic and could apply to any student",
          "Focuses on what you need rather than what you offer",
          "Lacks specific examples and stories",
          "Doesn't connect to scholarship's leadership focus",
          "Misses opportunity to show unique value"
        ],
        "content_feedback": "Your answer touches on important points but needs more depth and specificity. Instead of listing credentials, tell a story that demonstrates your leadership and impact. The question isn't really about 'deserving'—it's about showing how you align with the scholarship's values and what unique perspective you bring. Avoid focusing on financial need in merit-based interviews unless specifically asked. Instead, emphasize the impact you've made and will make.",
        "delivery_feedback": "The phrase 'I deserve' can sound entitled. Consider reframing as 'I believe I'm a strong candidate because...' or 'I would be honored to receive this scholarship because...' This shows confidence while remaining humble.",
        "suggested_answer": "I believe I'm a strong candidate for this scholarship because of my commitment to servant leadership, which aligns closely with your organization's values. For example, when I noticed that first-generation students at my school were struggling to navigate college applications, I didn't just tutor them—I created a peer mentorship program that has now helped over 50 students. This experience taught me that true leadership isn't about personal achievement; it's about empowering others. As a scholarship recipient, I would bring this same approach to your scholar community, actively contributing to programs and mentoring future applicants. I'm excited about the opportunity to learn from other scholars and expand my impact.",
        "next_steps": [
          "Prepare 2-3 specific stories that demonstrate your unique qualities",
          "Research the scholarship's mission and values deeply",
          "Practice reframing 'why I deserve' as 'what I offer'",
          "Use the STAR method to structure your examples",
          "Record yourself answering and watch for confident body language"
